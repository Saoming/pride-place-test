pridePlaces-codingChallenge

Hello Everyone, This is Samuel Tirtawidjaja and this is my Coding Challenges for pride places. Hope you liked it. 

## Project Context
=> REQUIREMENTS

Complete the following instructions using React or vanilla js(bonus points for using nextjs framework).
Push your work to a public repository.
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this API [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch posts.
Display all the posts titles on the screen however you like.

Clicking on a post should open up a modal, the modal should display
- the post author's name
- the post author's catchPhrase
- the post title
- the post body
- a close button
- The modal's close button should close the modal. Clicking outside of the modal should also close the modal. How you style the modal is up to you.

HINTS:
- Keep different screen sizes in mind - Leave comments - read the API docs -> https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/ - keep the styling simple (or go wild)
Good luck!
